### Implementation of SON algorithm to find all the possible combinations of the frequent itemsets

## CASE 1:
We would like to calculate the combinations of frequent movies (as singletons, pairs, triples, etc…) that
were rated by male users and are qualified as frequent given a support threshold value.

## CASE 2:
In the second case we want to calculate the combinations of frequent female users (as singletons, pairs,triples, etc…) who rated the movies. The frequent combination of female users has to be calculated on the basis of the support threshold value.
